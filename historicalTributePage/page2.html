        <h1> Arthell Isom Begining To End</h1>
        <p> Arthell Isom always had an intrest in animation. He loved cartoons and wanted to make it his career. So he moved to Japan, but he couldn't get enerolled becuase the school did except forgieners. So he started paperwork to be a Japenede citizen. After he was an ofical citizen he finally got accepted to <i>Yoyogi,</i> and spent years praactining his animation skills. After he graduated he become a freelance animator. Soon he started working with <i>Ogura Koubou animation studio,</i> he worked on shows like <i>Bleach, Black Bultler, and Naruto.</i> </p>
        <p> His work at Ogura Koubou studio gave him eough experience and helped him make his mark. So with the help of his twi brother, <i> Darnell Isom</i> he created Japan's first major black owned animation studio, <i>f D'Art Shtajio</i>. Isom now works on popular shows such as <i> Attack on Titan, One Piece, and Tokyo Ghoul, </i> he also works on comercials and music videos. /p>
            <p> He is important because he was the first black person to make a major animation studio in Japan. Isom is living proof that anything is possible if you put your mind to it. He wasn't given a head start. He had to work hard to get where he is now. He couldn't even get into <i> Yoyogi </i> until he become a citizen. And he got kicked out of <i> The Academy Of Arts</i>. But he didnt let these things stop him, and now he's going down in history. </p>
